Program 1: Volume Calculation Using Object Data Members

AIM:

To write a C++ program that calculates the volume of a cube using public data members directly in `main()`.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:

A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that can contain data members and member functions. In this program, an object of the class `cube` is created, and the volume is calculated in the `main()` function by accessing public data members directly.

Algorithm:

1. Define a class `cube` with public data members: `height`, `width`, and `length`.
2. In the `main()` function, create an object of the class.
3. Calculate the volume using the formula: `volume = height × width × length`.
4. Display the result.

Conclusion:

The program successfully calculates the volume of a cube using public data members of a class.



Program 2: Volume Calculation Using Member Function

AIM:

To write a C++ program to calculate the volume of a cube using a member function within the class.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:

Member functions are functions defined inside a class and used to operate on class data members. This program encapsulates the volume calculation within a member function, demonstrating the principle of data abstraction in object-oriented programming.

Algorithm:

1. Define a class `cube` with public data members and a member function `volume()`.
2. Implement the `volume()` function to return `height × width × length`.
3. In `main()`, create an object of the class.
4. Call the `volume()` function using the object.
5. Display the result.

Conclusion:

The program successfully calculates the volume of a cube using a class member function.

Program 3: Volume Calculation Using Private Data Members and Encapsulation

AIM:

To write a C++ program that uses private data members and a public member function to compute the volume of a cube.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. It restricts direct access to data members and allows manipulation only through public methods. In this program, all dimensions are private, and the volume is calculated using a public member function.

Algorithm:

1. Define a class `cube` with private members: `height`, `width`, and `length`.
2. Create a public member function `volume()` that computes and returns the volume.
3. In `main()`, create an object and call the `volume()` function.
4. Display the result.

Conclusion:

The program demonstrates encapsulation by calculating the volume of a cube using private data members and a public function.

Program 4: Volume Calculation Using User Input**

AIM:

To write a C++ program that calculates the volume of a box using user input and class member functions.

Software Used:

Programiz

Theory:
This program demonstrates the use of classes, member functions, and user input in C++. It collects the dimensions of a box from the user and calculates the volume using a separate function. This structure supports modularity and reusability of code.

Algorithm:

1. Define a class `Volume` with public data members: `length`, `breadth`, and `height`.
2. Define a member function `input()` to take input from the user.
3. Define another function `vol()` to calculate the volume.
4. Define a function `display()` to show the result.
5. In `main()`, create an object of the class and call these functions in sequence.

Conclusion:

The program successfully accepts input from the user and calculates the volume of a box using member functions.
